        <p> The Nimrod, designed by John Makepeace Bennett, built by Raymond Stuart-Williams and exhibited in the 1951 Festival of Britain, is considered to be the first gaming computer to ever be conceived. Bennett did not intend for it to be a real gaming computer, however, as it was supposed to be an exercise in mathematics as well as to prove computers could "carry out very complex practical problems", not purely for enjoyment. After this point, gaming consoles like the Magnavox Odyssey (released in 1972) and the Atari 2600 (released 1977) paved the way for the future of not just gaming consoles, but gaming computers as well with their increasing popularity with families everywhere. Computers as people know them today were not a new thing as they share a common lineage with the first "modern" computer made in 1942: the Atanasoff–Berry Computer (ABC for short). Unlike modern desktops and laptops, the ABC was a gargantuan machine that occupied "1,800 square feet… weighing almost 50 tons", nowhere near a suitable size for one person to use. It wasn't until the Apple II and the Commodore 64, released in 1977 and 1982 respectively, that personal computers became more appealing for general consumer use. These computers were not cheap with the Apple II costing buyers $1,298 back in 1977, or around $5,633 adjusted for 2021 inflation, but their overall computing power, efficiency, and compact size was a big step up from even the most advanced computers back when they were first being developed. Today, many companies offer gaming computers in a variety of configurations. Dell has their gaming computer division, Alienware, which formed all the way back in 1997, HP has theirs, OMEN, whose lineage dates back to 1991 under the defunct brand VoodooPC, Lenovo has theirs Legion, Asus has theirs under their own TUF and ROG, Acer has their special product lines, Predator, that coexist with the rest of their line-up, and much more. All of these brands look to gain a piece of the market either with affordability, features, build-quality, performance, or a mixture of all these.
